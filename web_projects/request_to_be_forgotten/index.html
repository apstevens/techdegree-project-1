                <p>Given the sensitive nature of erasing personal data, GDPR Article 17(1) requires certain conditions to be met before a request may be considered. 
                Please supply us with the reason you wish your data to be erased and please attach any justifying documents to this one.</p>
                <p>Please tick the appropriate box:</p>

                <p>Please describe the information you wish to erase. Please provide any relevant details you think will help us to identify the information.</p>
                <p>Also, please explain, if it is not abundantly clear, why you believe the data held is about you or the person you are representing on this form.</p>
                <p>Please note that. In certain circumstances, where erasure would adversely affect the freedom of expression, contradict a legal obligation, act against the
                public interest in the area of public health, act against the public interest in the area of scientific or historical research, or prohibit the establishment of
                a legal defense or exercise of other legal claims, we may not be able to erase the information you requested in accordance with article 17(3) of the GDPR. In such 
                cases you will be informed promptly and given full reasons for that decision.</p>
                <p>While in most cases we will be happy to erase the personal data you request, we nevertheless reserve the right, in accordance with Article 12(5) of the GDPR,
                to charge a fee or refuse the request if it is considered to be “manifestly unfounded or excessive.” However we will make every effort to provide you with the erasure
                of your personal data if suitable.</p><br>
